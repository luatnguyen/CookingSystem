Place the oxtails, marrow bones, beef shin and pork hocks in a large (at least 8-quart) pot. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil over high heat. Let boil for a few minutes, then remove from the heat. Scoop out the bones and meat into the colander and discard the water. Wash the pot. Rinse off the bones and meat and put them back into the pot. Fill with fresh cold water to cover by 1 inch. Add the yellow onion halves and 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Periodically skim the foam and some, but not all, of the fat. Simmer until the meats are tender but not falling apart, 1 to 1 1/2 hours, then remove the beef shins and pork hocks. When the meats are completely cool, wrap them in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.","cookingSteps":null,"ingredient":["5 pounds oxtail and/or beef marrow bones","1 pound boneless beef shin (or flank steak)","2 pounds pork hocks (not smoked)","4 scallions, sliced"],"image":null,"categoryID":"bf507aa5-fb15-44e3-8eaa-7c3a960e6c79","nutritionFact":null,"no":0}]
